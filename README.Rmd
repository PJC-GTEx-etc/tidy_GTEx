This repository hold the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project](https://gtexportal.org/home/) data in a tidy format for easy use with the R [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).

> "The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 53 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. Remaining samples are available from the GTEx Biobank. The GTEx Portal provides open access to data including gene expression, QTLs, and histology images."

## Git Large File Storage

This repository uses git large file storage ("git-lfs") in order to manage the large data files.

### Installation

The instructions on installing git-lfs for Mac, Windows, and some linux distros are available on the [git-lfs GitHub repo Wiki](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation#source). Since I did this work remotely on the HMS Research Computing Cluster, I do not have root access and had to install from source. 

1. Download the source code of the latest release from [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/latest).

```bash
wget https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.7.2/git-lfs-v2.7.2.tar.gz
```

2. Build the binary using `go build -o /path/to/dest/git-lfs`, where `/path/to/dest/git-lfs` is the name of the directory you store your installed software in. This directory should be in your `$PATH`. For instance, I used `~/bin/git-lfs`.

```bash
module load go
go build -o ~/bin/git-lfs
```

There should now be a file with the same path and name that you passed using the `-o` flag.

3. Set up git-lfs in your git repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/my/git/repo
git lfs install
#> Updated git hooks.
#> Git LFS initialized.
```

4. Declare which files to track.

```bash
git lfs track "*.bigfiles"
#> Tracking "really_big_file.bigfiles"
#> Tracking "so_big_such_wow.bigfiles"
#> Tracking "large_files_rock.bigfiles"
```

where `"*.bigfiles"` is the regular expression for large files in the repo.

5. Track ".gitattributes".

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit .gitattributes -m "start git-lfs"
```

You should now be able to add, commit, and push files like normal. Steps 1 and 2 only need to be done once per machine. Steps 3-5 need to be completed once per repository.
